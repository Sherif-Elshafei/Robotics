# Robotics
Python code where I create 3D computer vision robotics application modules. Core applications can be cascaded and/or customized to achieve more complex computer vision tasks.

# Usage
Use basic Python run commands
```
python3 <file_name>
```
Or use in Jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook . &
```
